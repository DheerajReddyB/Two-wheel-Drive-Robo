# Two-wheel-Drive-Robo
During a workshop my team and I have made a two wheel drive robo with three different censors using the arduino board and programmed it.
1. Using light censors to detect the path of black line
2. Using ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacle
3. using bluetooth module to connect to phone and control it.
